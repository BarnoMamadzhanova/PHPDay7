Create a simple Class called Vehicles. This Class should have the properties: name, model, makeYear, color, fuelType.
Use a constructor. Create a method which will return the name and the model of this vehicle. 



<!-- Instantiate 3 new objects from this Class. 

Once you have done creating these objects, create a new Class called Ships. This Class will extend the Vehicles Class. 
Add new properties and methods to this Class.
